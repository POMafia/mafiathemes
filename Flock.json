		"Power Roles: Hawlucha (revealing Samurai), Staraptor (Mayor + One Shot nonrevealing Samurai), Talonflame (Vigilante), Pidgeot (Mayor + One Shot Vigilante), Chatot (nonrevealing Exposer), Hoothoot/Noctowl (Inspector), Mega Altaria (Bodyguard), Togekiss (Pretty Lady), Swellow (Tracker, Watcher), Delibird (Neighbor), Fearow (Spy).",
		"Threats: Crobat (poison, this theme has no safeguarder or detoxer), Legendary Egg (Ho-Oh and Rayquaza can daykill while Lugia has a piercing nightkill), Arceus-Flying (piercing nightkill, daykill).",
		"Claiming: Once the aforementioned threats have been eliminated (and Mega Altaria is still alive), Hoothoot/Noctowl can claim. Chatot is the next safest claim afterwards, followed by Swellow.",
		"Gyarados (and Salamence): This role can choose to increase its vote by 1 (caps at 6) or gain a -1 voteshield (caps at -6) when it nightkills.",
		"Krow's Crew: Zero information and very little protection (Mandibuzz can protect), but a LOT of kill power (Crobat's poison functions as a delayed unshared kill, Mega Aerodactyl has an unshared kill every night, Drifblim revenges nightkills).",
		"Odd Birds: Very low initial kill power (no one can poison or has any unshared kills), but a lot of information (Charizard's double /inspect), very high survivability (Dragonite's /protect), and incredible scaling (Gyarados and Salamence).",
		"Arceus-Flying: This role is very difficult to kill. It is also a conspirator, meaning it wins with any and all sides. Village and mafia need to keep both of these in mind when considering whether to save or eliminate Arceus.",
		"Nightkill Evasion: Togekiss (50%), Arceus-Flying (65%), Legendary Egg (100%), Lugia (50%), Yveltal (50%).",

NEW ROLES: Drifblim, Salamence, Dragonite, Charizard, Arceus-Flying. Ledian (spy) renamed to Fearow; removed hax on day actions, while night action hax will only reveal the target, never the user. Rayquaza survives one lynch instead of gaining an additional kill before dying. Mega Altaria is a standard bodyguard (no longer vengeful). Removed the pierce chance and fail chance of Mega Aerodactyl's edge. Staraptor's vote is always 3 and is now a one-shot samurai (does not reveal). Swellow can watch or stalk (can't do both on the same night). Made Pidgeotto and Pidgeot masons while removing their chance to evade nightkills. Reduced Pidgeot's vote to 2; is now an OSV instead of a vigilante. Reduced Pidgeotto's vote to 1. Hoothoot can no longer evolve into Noctowl. Hoothoot's inspects are now 100% accurate. Noctowl can inspect twice a night. Togekiss has a 50% chance to evade nightkills instead of evading a single nightkill. Crobat's poison kills after 1 night (instead of on the same night). Gyarados (and Salamence) can either /intimidate (or /int) to gain a -1 voteshield (caps at -6) or /moxie to increase their vote by 1 (caps at 6); these are both kill commands."
