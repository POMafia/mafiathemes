Of course, I can't 100% guarantee your safety, but you are being given a chance to save the world from curses! If everyone can work together and follow Madoka's lead, surely nothing bad will happen. You might even get to battle the legendary Walpurgisnacht! Doesn't that sound fun?",

    "Unique Commands": "This theme uses some uncommon commands, so please familiarize yourself with them. Hitomi's Gossip reveals the role to the target, but the user is killed if used on a Witch. Sayaka can Shield, but this also blocks and cures poison. Shroud is a command that some Witches have to protect them from Power Roles.",
    "Claiming": "Nope!",
    "Expose": "Magical Girls are usually good - however, Kirika and Oriko are Magical Girls not aligned with the Village!",
    "Lynch": "Because a lot of unpredictable things can happen during the lynch phase, think before you vote."
  },
  "variables": {
    "villagerhelp": "I certainly can't deny your absence of special abilities. However, even your small wishes are significant, so /Vote off Witches during the Vote Phase!",
    "madokahelp": "The scale of power your abilities are on is quite befuddling, even for me. You possess the ability to illuminate the darkness and /Expose someone during the day. With such power, you're a natural leader for those who fear the Witches! It's beyond my understanding why you should have such latent power, but if anything attempts to remove you from existence during the vote phase, they will all be erased as well!",
    "madokahelp2": "The scale of power your abilities are on is quite befuddling, even for me. You possess the ability to illuminate the darkness and /Expose someone during the day. With such power, you're a natural leader for those who fear the Witches! It's beyond my understanding why you should have such latent power, but if anything attempts to remove you from existence during the vote phase, they will all be erased as well! You are a beacon of hope to your fellow Magical Girls, so all who follow your vote in the vote phase will have their vote strength doubled!",
    "sayakahelp": "The self-proclaimed heroine of justice - that's you! You are willing to put your life on the line for your friends, and you can thus /Shield them to take their kills and heal of Poison! This is of course risky, but your healing magic will allow you to survive a single nightkill. Additionally, if you are voted off during the day, you will be able to exact your own definition 'vigilante justice'!",
    "sayaka2help": "Now that you're fighting like this, you can strike down enemies with an extremely fast /Kill! However, you've probably exposed yourself to gain this power, so you should ask for someone to protect you!",
    "hitomihelp": "Well, you don't have to be a Magical Girl to stand against the world's curses. In fact, you are perfectly capable of helping your friends fight witches! You can /Gossip to anyone else, causing them to identify you. However, I should warn you that I can't predict what will happen if you use it on a Witch...",
    "mamihelp": "Your years of experience make you quite the veteran, Mami! With your expertise, you can /Inspect [name] during the night to find out someone's role! You can also distract someone during the night, but be careful, though, because Kirika will kill you if you try to Distract her...",
    "nagisahelp": "You're a cute little Magical Girl, and you are known to be Mami's closest friend in the world of Rebellion! Unfortunately, others may still think you are a Witch. Work with Mami to save the Magical Girls with your /Protect and /Watch!",
    "kyoukohelp": "Wow, I didn't know the human body could metabolize food that fast. That side, your agility and strength make you a powerful adversary for any Witch or Magical Girl! So much so, that you can ruthlessly /Kill anyone during the day. Additionally, thanks to your illusory powers (Rosse Phantom), you will not be seen when you do so!",
    "homurahelp": "You sure are a curious one, Akemi Homura. I'd really like to know where you got your mysterious powers! Somehow you are able to protect yourself without fail every night! No one believes the things you say, so your vote counts as -2. It seems that your latent magical power is on such a scale that I can't even predict what will happen if you get lynched...",
    "yumahelp": "You are quite the nimble one, Chitose Yuma! Though you may be small, you are always willing to stand up for your friends! Use your low profile to /stalk one person during the night! Due to your healing magic, you will survive the first nightkill you receive. Addtionally, your vote counts as -3.",
    "kirikahelp": "Since I have no means of predicting your emotional patterns, I can't tell if you're homicidal or completely harmless; you clearly have the capacity to be both. Naturally, no one would be able to recognize you as a threat; you appear as a Magical Girl if exposed! However, you can /Kill them with ease during the night, and due to your time-slowing magic, you can strike before most Bodyguards and escape all Distractors! If someone tries to Inspect you during the night, you'll simply obliterate them.",
    "orikohelp": "I must say, your ability of prescience makes this help message somewhat obsolete. But in case it should present a time paradox, I'd better explain your abilities. Since you are able to foresee disaster, you can /Protect anyone during the night. You also possess the karmic strength to alter fate itself with your magnificent vote of 1000! You can also kill during the day, but you will definitely be revealed if you do.",
    "akumahelp": "Just what kind of entity are you!? The best guess I can offer is: a Demon! Now you cannot be killed at all, and in fact will only die in the circumstance that Madoka does; your fates are completely intertwined! You devilish powers of memory manipulation allow you to vote almost anyone off with a vote 666, and you can also obliterate literally anything in the universe during the day with your /Kill! Now then, I think I'll be leaving until this is all sorted out...",
    "gertrudehelp": "The Distrustful Witch, born of all negative emotion, you must /Kill the pitiful humans and feed them to the roses within your barrier, and they will be beautiful roses!! Additionally, your psychedelic SHAFT effects are more than enough to /Distract one person per night.",
    "anthonyhelp": "The fuzzball with a mustache, you are tasked with landscaping the barrier's interior, you can mysteriously make someone appear to be a witch with /Shroud [name]! You also share the team's /Kill, and can /Protect you master (this is shared with other Anthonies)!",
    "kirstenhelp": "As the Covetous Witch, you have a tendency to steal from others. Thus, in addition to your /Kill, you can /Drain [name] to demote a Magical Girl into a Bystander, while also increasing your own strength! The first boost will increase your vote to 2; the second will make you appear as an Innocent Bystander; the third will make you immune to Distract; and the fourth will grant you a non-revealing daykill!",
    "elsahelp": "The Shadow Witch, who embodies all-consuming self-righteousness, you can spread darkness with /Shroud, blocking out all the Magical Girl's enchantments, in addition to your /Kill! You will also kill the first to vote you if lynched, and possess a vote of 2. You are protected from normal kills during the night.",
    "sebasthelp": "The Shadow Witch's minion, whose duty it is to blindly believe, you must follow your leader at all costs! Help Elsa Maria kill during the Night, and additionally /Shroud [name] to obscure someone's identity.",
    "charlottehelp": "Your tenacity is matched only by your own insatiability for desserts! Your sweet tooth allows you to /poison one target during the night, and /fake poison on another! You are incapable of giving up or losing heart, so you cannot be killed like normal witches, and if you are lynched, you will transform into your second form!",
    "walpurgishelp": "The amalgamation of all Witches, the epitome of helplessness and despair, you are the fear of all who pray for hope! Like most Witches, you can /Shroud, but unlike other Witches, you have no need to hide, because you barely be killed at all! If you are lynched you will bring down two of those who voted you as well! Starting day 4, you can kill up to 3 times during the day, and you will not be revealed!",
    "sayakabombmessage": "For all the hope you can wish on one, you cannot help but bring an equal amount of despair onto another!",
    "madokabombmessage": "With Madoka gone, it seems Homura has disappeared as well...",
    "sayakarevengemessage": "±Sayaka: I, Magical Girl Sayaka, will devote myself to Justice!",
    "homuraconvertmsg": "This darkness... it bears more curse than Sin itself! What has become of ~Self~ (Akuma Homura)!?",
