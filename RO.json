Rogue stalks every night. Bard is no longer a day bomb but has 2 distracts now. New role: Dancer. Hoping to add a new mafia team.",

		"7.26.2014": "Poring and Poporing can change into mafia roles (the same way Novices can change into first class jobs). All first class jobs (Acolyte, Archer, Mage, Merchant, Ninja, Swordsman, Thief) can't change into second class jobs until the second night. Novices can now change into Super Novices (1x distract, 1x protect, 1x inspect) on the third night. Bard's freeze (distract) fail chance increased from 30% to 50%. Prevent Teamvote added. Alchemist's vote changed from -3 to 1.01. Priority list changed a bit: Mistress's distract is now faster than Bard's /sing and Dancer's /dance but still slower than Bard's /freeze and Dancer's /scream. Assassin's /venom priority increased to be the same as Golden Thief Bug's poison (outspeeds all kills except Valk Randgris and Buffed Ninja). Adjusted spawn list a bit as well. Dark Illusion spawns at 11 (instead of 12), while Mage spawns at 12 (instead of 11).",

		"8.28.2014": "Thanatos's inspect's accuracy increased from 50% to 100% (always right now). Bapho Jr. can change to either Fire Baphomet (2 daykills per day; the first doesn't reveal, the second reveals) or Shadow Baphomet (2 kills per night; the second is unshared but has a good chance of being haxed). Thief Bug can change to Male Thief Bug (protect) or Female Thief Bug (convert itself every other night to gain 15% nightkill evasion and a -1 voteshield); it can still change into Golden Thief Bug as well. Mistress can convert one person to their previous class every other night (lowest priority of the game, can be blocked by Priest's /heal; Thanatos and Super Novices that were Poring or Poporing can't be demoted). Poring and Poporing can no longer change to mafia. Instead, they change to Super Novices whose commands are dummy (will fail).",
		"9.21.2014": "Added demoted Merchant to VCLR. Both Archer's shoot (distract) and Super Novice's distract now have a lower priority than Mistress's distract. Fire Baphomet is renamed Baphomet, while Shadow Baphomet is renamed Unsealed Baphomet.",

		"5.24.2015": "Increased Assassin's chance to evade nightkills to 50%. Increased Rogue's hax on kills and poisons."
