        "24.06.2015": "Ryu added to Third Party characters as a low priority nightkiller that bypass protections (in addition to shared poison). Luigi can now inspect to find if a player can daykill, nightkill, poison or neither. Pikachu/Pichu now have a recharge of 1 turn after using /kill. Ice Climbers' poison now kill in 4 turns. Duck Hunt evades 1 nightkill, 1 daykill and 1 poison. Pikmins can /shield once per game. Toon/Young Link can dayprotect (protect teammate from daykills and exposes), but can only kill if they are the last member alive of the team. Zelda now expose side instead of role and has a 50% chance of evading daykills. Sheik dayinspects instead of exposing. Zelda and Sheik can /transform into the other during the day. Zero Suit Samus' vote is now +2. Wolf can now copy someone's vote as twice their value for 1 turn.",
        "01.06.2015": "Slightly increased Luigi and Dr. Mario's hax. Added recharge of 3 turns to Dr. Mario's /cure. Sheik now has a 50% chance of evading nightkills. Reduced Captain Falcon's voteshield from -4 to -3. Fire Emblem's kill is now faster than Mario team",
