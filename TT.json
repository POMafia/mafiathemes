With the likes of Slade, The H.I.V.E., Trigon, and even Mumbo trying to destroy everything, it's up to the Teen Titans and their friends to defend the city! If they succeed, peace will be restored in Jump City and secured everywhere else in the world. If the Titans fail, the world will be thrown into total chaos! Teen Titans GO! A/N: This theme is part of TCC3, but something I've been meaning to make for a while. If you find any bugs, or have any questions/concerns, please contact either myself, Honey Senpai, or SkyPhoenix. And yes, this is based on the old anime not the new cartoon on Cartoon Network. ~Joeypals",
