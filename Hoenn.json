    "summary": "The Good Pokemon of Hoenn must protect their homes! Can they defend against the begrudging ghosts, Shuppet, Dusclops, and Banette? Or will Mightyena, Cacturne, and Sharpedo spread eternal darkness over the land? Maybe Ninjask and Shedinja will infest Hoenn with Bugs or Salamence and Altaria will overrun the good guys with their draconion powers. With the odds against them, certain Pokemon can Mega Evolve when they are the last remaining member of their team! Who will come out on top? Find out in this game of Hoenn!
