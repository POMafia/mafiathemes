"summary": "In a desolate, crime-ridden city, three different gangs from three different parts of town decide to settle their differences once and for all: there can only be one surviving clan. A neighborhood assassin who does things his own way and a village leader from another land want a piece of the action as well. Back-stabbing, bluffing, and betrayal are all commonplace in this theme - are you up for the challenge? Fegelein is the current owner of ClanWar, PM him with suggestions/feedback. Originally created by Grasseh. In small games, NA no longer has 2 votes.",
