Roles that evade daykills now make their daykillers use up their charges. PreventTeamvote and TeamTalk added for Clown Fish and Sea Anemone as well as Angel Fish and Devil Ray. Sword Fish can no longer be haxed by Fish while in its defensive stance, and when killed or lynched, its stance will be revealed. Clown Fish keeps its vote of 2 when Sea Anemone dies. Devil Ray's hax rate increased and it always has a vote of 3. Sushi Chef knows who he can convert, but not what role they are (similar to Marx). Mermaid can distract up to three people a night. Another version of Remora has been added for large games; this version can stalk three people a night and has a -5 voteshield."
