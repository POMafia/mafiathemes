        "July 28, 2018": "Revamped for game night. Inspector Finneon can only check if someone is a Chinchou or not. Bomb Finneon bombs everything now (including lynch). Vigilante Finneon can't change their target once they choose whom to kill, and BG Finneon knows who Vigilante Finneon is killing. Mayor Finneon's vote increased to 5. Evolver Finneon will convert into Lumineon on Night 4. Floatzel counters nightkills but no longer evades daykills. Completely revamped spawn (a lot of roles that appeared later in the game now appear much earlier). Removed Shiny Chinchou. Fixed a ton of grammar/spelling issues and inconsistencies with the code."
