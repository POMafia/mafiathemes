As such, you can redirect any action onto anybody else by typing /redirect Name@Name. All actions of the first name will be used on the second name. You don't need to go anywhere to do this, so you will not be seen visiting anybody if you are stalked. This also means you won't be killed during the night. Since you have cameras everywhere, you have a very good chance of finding out who is visiting who. You'll identify inspectors and reveal as a random role.
