Barbossa can be PL'd now, but Cannon outspeeds. Reversed Jack's distract immunity (now is only after lynch). Removed Gilette/Norrington startup and Liz/Will hax.",

    "January 24, 2014": "Major update. Norrington now Inspects. Jack no longer Protects. Gibbs no longer Distracts and now Protects. Beckett is now a JOAT and can Poison, Protect, Inspect, or Distract every night but must alternate. Spawn is pretty different now too. Privateers bomb last voter. Mullroy/Murtogg can't kill immunes, but their kill is broadcast. Gilette has -2 vote again."
