Also, Space is winning too much so Zurg's big game vote was lowered to three and more changes may be made to small game. Replaced Godzilla with King Kong to buff Monsters in roles3. Then, completely swapped space mafia and monster mafia and fixed up the spawn because Space keeps winning everything, somehow. Maximus doesn't spawn until WAY late and Serial killers come in a little earlier. Also, Khan can inspect every other night and Kong can protect himself.",

        "John McClane": "Remember that you reveal yourself more than half of the time. Make sure to use your kills wisely and when they're needed or safe.",
        "Jaws": "In small games, your only real hope of winning is to (help) get rid of Sherlock and Khan before they find you, so don't be afraid of that reveal...",
        "Jack Sparrow": "Jack can inspect people as Maximus, Jaws, Zurg, Terminator, Buzz, Godzilla, Sherlock, King Kong, and Viewer. If you get any results NOT listed here, you are Sherlock Holmes.",
        "Small Games": "Nosferatu 'mutes' people, taking away their vote. Charlie Chaplin can 'unmute' people, giving their vote back, but this will also raise Nosferatu's vote to 2 if he's targetted with Charlie.'s action. The goal is to find out who is Nosferatu by having Mrs. Doubtfire distract people and if someone is not muted, the distracted person is most likely Nosferatu.",
	"Top Threats": "Jaws has a daykill. Darth Vader has a second kill and Zurg has extra votes. Terminator can outspeed bodyguards and when lynched, has two kills that outspeed bodyguards. Don Vito Corleone is a votekiller and can convert some roles to Mafia Goons. Freddy Kreuger kills anyone who tries to gain information about him (inspect, distract, stalk)."
