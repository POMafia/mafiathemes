When the war goes too far, strange creatures will take part of it, such as the legendary Millenium Fox, the venomous Naga, the impartial Shapeshifters or even a foolish Demonologist who mastered a forbidden spell allowing him to summon a god-like Demon. Even the Heavens may send their messenger, an Avatar, tasked to enlighten the path of the long forgotten Peace.",

        "14/04/2013: Vulpix (kuja) and Shepeshifter (conspirator) can now appear in average games and Leviathan can appear in semi-large games throught the random spawn feature, this is for tests purposes + A little buff for Kraken, mainly to make it rely less on the random luck: its vote and voteshield are now both varying between 1 and 8 instead of -2 and 5. Also, it has now a 2nd command /wrap + Phoenix can kill once every 4 nights instead of once per game. This breaks the stall as well as makes this role less boring + Sphinx renamed Fairy & Elf, sounds better this way and avoid some confusion too.

Additionally, their vote now counts randomly between 1 and 1.5 + Naga Jr. now leaves its targets poisoned if they were protected from their kill. (Just like the genuine Naga)",

In other words, Lamia, who was a Vigilante originally, is now a Spy.",
        "16/04/2013: Zombies' /bite priority has been drastically lowered + Sirens' distract now is not shared, it is limited to 2 uses per game per role and has a higher priority + Randomness in spawnlist has been reduced slightly + Griffin, Dragon and Harpy have now different priority on their shared kill. (This will hopefully fix any case where the whole team receives a poison when they kill a role with mode poisonattacker + The priority of Demonologist's /ward and Kraken's /wrap has been swapped.",

Also, when Summoned Demon is dead, Demonologist follows + Shapeshifter's form received some changes, mostly to make it less stall-ish: Tengu receives +6 extra votes if voted, Hydra receives +1 extra vote if voted, Kitsune has the same auto-win condition as Kumiho, and Unicorn has slightly higher chances to get hax.",
