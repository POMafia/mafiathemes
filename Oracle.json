All is peaceful, but when the Emperor's Army threatens to conquer the town, it's up to the Oracles and Genies to fight back! Use the Oracles' deaths and Genies' wishes to find and kill enemies. Some changes have been made, meaning old mechanics are no longer present (see: you do not need to use /see every night, genie wishes cannot be stored). And the Army still has teamtalk! Only to be played during FUN TIMES.",
